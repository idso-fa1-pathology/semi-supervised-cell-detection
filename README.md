# Advanced mIF Cell Detection with Semi-Supervised Learning

## Overview
This project introduces a breakthrough approach for enhancing cell detection in multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging through semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling. Leveraging the YOLOv8s model, we aim to significantly improve detection accuracy and efficiency across diverse cancer types.
