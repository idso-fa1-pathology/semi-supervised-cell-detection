# Advanced Multiplex Immunofluorescence Cell Detection using Semi-Supervised Learning

## Overview
This project develops a novel approach for cell detection in multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging, leveraging semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labeling to address the challenge of limited and unevenly distributed annotations. The method significantly enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of cell detection across different cancer types, employing YOLOv8s for its superior performance.
